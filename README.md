## Setup Credentials

**Now collect all the required credentials from your accounts put them or update `client/.env` and `server/.env` files.**

> You can add `JWT_SECRET` as you want. But, I would suggest to get a random 16/32 bits `base64` string. Just visit this [webpage](https://generate.plus/en/base64)
